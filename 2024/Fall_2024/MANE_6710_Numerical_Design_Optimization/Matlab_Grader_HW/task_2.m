% Math Expression with Variables (arithmetic)

%Define variables a, b, c, and d 
a = 2.2;
b = 5.1;
c = -3.1;
d = 1.8;

%Enter commands to evaluate the expressions and assign the results 
%to the variable names given in the problem statement.  Note the values of the variables
%a, b, c, and d are defined in lines 2-5.  Be sure not to overwrite these values with your
%own code.

A1 = sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2);
A2 = a*(b+c)/(25*d^2);
A3 = a*c/(5* (b+d)^(2/3));

Answer1 = A1
Answer2 = A2
Answer3 = A3
